To add components to the PC case that holds everything, just use one of your hands to place in in the right spot.
The first component you will put in the PC case is a Motherboard. A motherboard is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in general-purpose computers and other expandable systems. It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard)
A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry that executes instructions comprising a computer program. The CPU performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions in the program. This goes in a specific socket on the MotherBoard, and will need a cooling solution to not overheat. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit)
M.2 is the current high-speed standard for massive storage expansion in computers. This Solid State Drive will be place in the MotherBoard. In this build, the computer's Operating System (OS) will be installed on it along with any applications, documents, or images that the user desires. ()
Random-access memory or RAM is a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code. A RAM device allows for the fast transportation of data to be used in programs and applications. Typically, RAM sticks go directly on the MotherBoard. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory)
A graphics card (also called a video card or GPU) is an expansion card which generates a feed of output images to a display device, such as a computer monitor. Graphics cards are sometimes called discrete or dedicated graphics cards to emphasize their distinction to integrated graphics. This large piece of hardware has its own integrated cooling solution and is placed in a PCIE slot on the MotherBoard. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_card)

A Power Supply Unit (PSU) converts AC electricity from the wall to a lower DC voltage that the computer can use. This will be give the MotherBoard the power it needs to operate with the other components. (Some other components may also needed to be connected to the PSU.)
