To add components to the PC case that holds everything, just use one of your hands to place in in the right spot.
The first component you will put in the PC case is a Motherboard. A motherboard is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in general-purpose computers and other expandable systems. It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals.
